# FORD GO BIKE Exploration

## Dataset

The data consisted of over 100,000 records of bike trips. 
The attributes included the five categorical varables, as well as additional information 
such as the names of the stations, the latitudes and longitudes, and few others.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there was a trend that was occuring between the
age of the members, the duration of the trips and the individual categorical variables.
The heatmaps show either short and wide cloud maps or narrow and higher cloud maps, 
showing that the longer trips tend to be made more by members of relatively younger people.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focused on the logarithmic explorations, for the ones with 
log transformations, as those are the ones that showed the true insight. I also made sure 
to try my best to plot all the variables of interest single-handedly, together one-on-one, 
and together with other. I figured that this way, trends are seen more clearly; from 
exploration, to rising thoughts and further questions, to infering and conclusion
